# Compare Distributions of Random Variables

Distribution comparison is one of the first steps every data scientist takes.

scatter plots, types of cars on the x-asis and hwy mpgs on the y axis.
- lack of hwy mpg statistics, which car has the highest mean hwy mpgs
- overlap

gitter plot
- expands the datapoints over the xaxis
- overlap is less, making it easier to visualize their distributions

violin plot
- exact shape of distribution for each type of car class
- flipped histogram and mirrored

box plots
- show the distribution of data
- includes statistical info (50% of the data points fall into that range of the box)
- median, upper quartile (25% of data points more than this), upper extreme, lower quartile, lower extreme
- outliers that fall beyond the range of mean +- 2 * standard deviation

- compare the median of the highway mpgs
