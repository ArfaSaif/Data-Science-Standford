# About the dataset
# Life Expectancy dataset from (WHO)
#  there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life 
# expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates.
# 20 predicting variables. All predicting variables was then divided into several broad categories:
# â€‹Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors.


# Goal: will be doing multiple linear regression to find factors affecting life expectancy
# while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries.

# Applications of this study: Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, 
# it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower 
# value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance 
# in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.
