Time Series Data contains timestamps along the x axis.
It is a continous dataset instead of discrete dataset. Similar to ECG dataset. And could have 3 dimensions of data.

Determine distribution of Malaria in real time. Build a device that will be deployed over continent of Africa, that will automatically detect the mosquitos. The device uses a laser beam at the entrance of the box, if a mosquito flies into the box, the laser beam will detect it and generate time series data.
