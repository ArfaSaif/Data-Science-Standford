## What is Time Series Data?
Time Series Data contains timestamps along the x axis.
It is a continous dataset instead of discrete dataset. Similar to ECG dataset. And could have 3 dimensions of data.

Determine distribution of Malaria in real time. Build a device that will be deployed over continent of Africa, that will automatically detect the mosquitos. The device uses a laser beam at the entrance of the box, if a mosquito flies into the box, the laser beam will detect it and generate time series data.

Machine learning Model can learn the time series data and classify the species of the mosquitoes. Train a classifier to understand type of mosquito that exists.
