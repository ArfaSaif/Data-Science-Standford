## Real World: Time Series Analysis

Time Series is the new big data.

IoT and sensors leverage time series algorithms to save lives, money and make the world a better place. Time Series analysis is a very important sub-topic in Machine Learning.

- using EMF sensors to figure out how many people walk outside a store. Plotted the data to figure out the peak time that customers come. Found out it was 10pm and 7pm. The store closed as 7pm, 
- started to extend their timing

- timestamps discrete or continous (continous is time series)

- time series data used in different modalities in data mining 
- transform video to time series - and analyzing repeating patternsin the time serieos, possible to find the repeating segments
- tranform audio file to time series - mfcc algo and applying data mining techniques

# Time Series Data is the new Big Data

## Data Cleaning
- Motif Discovery: discovering repeating patterns that occur most frequestly in time series. 
- Rule Discovery: finding rules in order to mkae short term predictions
- Anomaly Detectin : find abornmal behaviour in time series
