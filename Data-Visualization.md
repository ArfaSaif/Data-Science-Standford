## Data Visualization

In any data science project, we need to explore the distribution of the variable, or a column in a dataset - usually using a histogram: by counting the number of instances that fall into defined ranges or bands. Scatter plots for visualization of data - two variables visualized in one plot. Mainly used to investigate correlation between variables.

Visualizing Three Variables
Assigning colors to different columns.

ggplot2, the package we use for creating plots

Plotly is a powerful package in R used for creating interactive plots which can significantly create more readable and informative plots.



Heat Map
When X and Y are cartesian coordinates. the Third variable is assigned to every x and y location. Ex. to plot the population of different states in the US.
In neuroscience, analyze brain process to aid process.
- displacement of body parts of mice based on each x and y location in the brain
- heat map can be created for this purpose, black cells show zero displacement, white have max displacement 
- visualization tool was chosen to visualize mice brain maps over multiple weeks
